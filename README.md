# Sequence-of-LPF
This program creates sequences of natural numbers reduced to their lowest  prime factor. Given a set of primes up to some p_n, the longest lpf sequences of primes up to p_n are the longest conceivable gap (combinatorially) between consecutive prime numbers less than p_n squared. I am trying to find insight on the distribution of primes.
